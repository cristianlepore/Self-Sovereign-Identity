# A Model To Assess Digital Identity Solutions

The purpose of this work is to extend the contribution of a model for assessing the adherence of e-Identity solutions to Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) [^lepore] by addressing the following research questions:

*1. RQ1: What are the principles of Self-Sovereign Identity?*
*2. RQ2: Can we use these principles to assess any SSI system?*

[Section 1](definition/Definition.md) proposes a definition of Self-Sovereign Identity and addresses RQ1, while [Section 2](model/Model.md) leverages this definition to propose a model for assessing e-identity solutions. Finally, [Section 3](testing/Testing.md) delves into a testing stage where the model is tested against existing solutions in the field of identity.

Besides taking inspiration from past exercises that define SSI principles [^allen][^ferdous][^toip][^toth][^cucko], this work departs from past contributions because it is not limited to defining SSI but is instrumental in exploiting a model to assess identity solutions. On the other hand, other SSI-based assessments fail to describe the methodology [^pava] or lack precision in their analysis [^bokkem][^omar].Additionally, we make our list of principles consistent through a questionnaire with experts participating at the ARES conference 2024.

Hereafter, we use the term principles for SSI interchangeably with the terms property and features. For the sake of clarity, they will all refer to the same concept. We often abbreviate the term Self-Sovereign Identity as SSI.
